# Simple eBPF filter

This repository contains a very basic eBPF example dropping any incoming
ICMP packet on attached interface. It is based on libbpf.

This example has been developed to illustrate the talk "Modify your kernel
at runtime with eBPF!" given at Capitole du Libre 2024, at Toulouse, France
